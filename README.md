# Open Source Sudoku

A Sudoku app built with Flutter and Dart.

At present, the app only supports Android. iOS support is not planned. I will have nothing to do with Apple since my account, which was supposed to be protected by two-factor authentication was hacked. Apple support said that they'd have somebody from security contact me within 3 to 4 business days with an explanation of how my account was hacked. Three years later, I'm still waiting for their explanation. So I will have nothing to do with Apple until they explain what happened. Totally shitty company to do business with.
