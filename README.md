# Open Source Sudoku

An open source Sudoku app built with Flutter and Dart.

At present, the app only supports Android. I don't have the resources to work on a iOS version. So an iOS version is not planned at this point.

The app is pretty functional at this point. 

With over 4000 pregenerated puzzles and 4 difficulty levels, there's always a new game waiting to be solved.

Things to-do at this point:

- [ ] Make the app more responsive in order to support landscape mode.
- [ ] Tweak the themes.
- [ ] Better icons.
- [ ] Help screen.
- [ ] About screen.


## Cloning the repository
If you clone the repository, be sure to go into **File -> Settings -> Languages & Frameworks** and set the Dart SDK path, enable the Dart SDK, and set the Flutter SDK path. These are machine-specific settings and aren't saved to the repository.

The app cannot be built and executed until these settings are configured correctly.
